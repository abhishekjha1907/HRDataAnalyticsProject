HR Data Analysis Project

Developed Data Insights Dashboard from Data provided by HR from Atliq Technologies.
It is a real Data Set, the dashboard focuses on -
1. People Working Preference - WFH, HWFH, 
2. Sick Leave Percentage by date
3. Presence Percentage by date
4. Work from Home Percentage by date

It helped the HR & the Admin dept to understand the headcount at any given day and manage the required resources & organize events in a much more efficient way.


The data is imported from Excel Workbook into the Power BI and the Data Cleaning process is done through Power Query, 
Finally the insights dashboard is generated by various filters and visualization tools.
